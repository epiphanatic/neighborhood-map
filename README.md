# neighborhood-map

Project #5 of Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. The task was to develop a single page application featuring a map (Google Maps) of my neighborhood. Then add functionality to the map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations via APIs, and various ways to browse the content.

Knockout was used as the framework, incorporating the MVVM pattern and making use of observables and filters.

All data requests are retrieved in an asynchronous manner and errors are handled gracefully.
